* Pico Pico! Sho-Pico!

Welcome to my experiments with PicoLisp. Maybe some of this will be useful
someday, but for now its just a space. This document is produced with Emacs
org-mode and the source is literate code. For example, in Emacs with this 
.org source, the following example block can be executed:

#+begin_src picolisp :results value
  "hello world"
#+end_src

PicoLisp on my system will evaluate it and put the results into this file:

: hello world

That's not all that impressive, but considering PicoLisp has a built in database
and web capabilities, it offers some intriguing possibilities for using org-mode
to do some literate programming.

One perfect match up is the list structures and org tables:

#+begin_src picolisp :results value
  '((a b c)
    (1 2 3)
    (x y z)
    (7 8 9))
#+end_src

| a | b | c |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| x | y | z |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
