* Pico Pico! Sho-Pico!

Welcome to my experiments with PicoLisp. Maybe some of this will be useful
someday, but for now its just a space. This document is produced with Emacs
org-mode and the source is literate code. For example, in Emacs with this 
.org source, the following example block can be executed:

#+begin_src picolisp :results value
  "hello world"
#+end_src

PicoLisp on my system will evaluate it and put the results into this file:

: hello world
